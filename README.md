Hi and welcome to my repository!

My name is Nikolai Fiathoski. Nowadays I work as an Import Analyst at DHL, however I'm fascinated about computer science since my early tennagehood. 
I created this repository as I'm studying to become a Java Developer in the near future. Here you may find all my notations throughout my studies and 
some projects I created to practice what I've learned.
